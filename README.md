# Advanced Statistical and Analytical Methods Project

## Overview

This project focuses on applying advanced statistical and analytical methods to solve complex problems. The primary goal is to leverage various techniques to forecast trends, analyze unstructured data, and perform segmentation and pattern recognition.

## Responsibilities

1. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Implement forecasting models to predict trends and seasonality.
   - Use techniques such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet for accurate predictions.

2. **Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining**
   - Apply sentiment analysis to understand the sentiment of textual data.
   - Perform text mining to extract useful information from unstructured data.
   - Utilize tools and libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or TextBlob for text processing.

3. **Clustering and Classification**
   - Explore clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) for segmenting data into meaningful groups.
   - Use classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM) for pattern recognition and categorization.
